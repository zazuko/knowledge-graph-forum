# Knowledge Graph Forum

This repository is intended for organizing the Knowledge Graph Forum. You can get tickets for the event in below.

![KG-Forum-2024](https://github.com/zazuko/knowledge-graph-forum/assets/583021/92afb264-0aa9-4356-86e2-4c67806877c5)

The Knowledge Graph Forum serves as a platform where companies are invited to share their ongoing work and use cases with Knowledge Graphs. Our goal is to encourage learning and sharing of valuable insights from their projects.

Presenters will be given 20 minutes to present their use case, followed by a 10-minute discussion slot. The focus will be on the practical aspects of implementation. It is important to note that vendor sales pitches are prohibited.

The event will also provide an excellent opportunity for networking and conversation on topics arising from the presentations. We'll conclude with a traditional Apéro Riche, a customary Swiss-style way to cap off a productive day with an assortment of drinks, finger foods, and snacks, ensuring a perfect blend of professional enrichment and social interaction.

The 2024 edition of the Knowledge Graph Forum is scheduled for **May 30, 2024 (Thursday)**. The venue is at the Roche Tower in Basel, Switzerland, generously provided by [Roche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche).

The CfP is closed, all sessions are selected.

**Registration for 2024**: [Tickets are on sale now](https://eventfrog.ch/en/p/science-and-technology/knowledge-graph-forum-2024-7183480931130241817.html).

## Previous editions

We've hosted two previous editions of the Knowledge Graph Forum, both outstanding events featuring numerous insightful presentations and engaging discussions.

* Presentations & slides from [2022](2022/README.md)
* Presentations & slides from [2019](2019/README.md)

## What we are looking for

We are keen on exploring a variety of topics and experiences related to RDF-based Knowledge Graphs, including:

* Real-world applications and case studies involving RDF-based Knowledge Graphs.
* Discussions on scaling RDF in practical scenarios, alongside showcasing prototypes, tools, libraries, and other relevant technologies.
* Insightful retrospectives on the use of RDF Knowledge Graphs, highlighting both successes and challenges. We highly value transparency and encourage sharing about projects that may not have met their objectives or faced obstacles.
* While we welcome contributions from consulting companies, we strongly prefer presentations delivered directly by the clients themselves, ensuring firsthand insights and experiences are shared.

## What we are *not* looking for

Our focus is to foster learning and exchange, steering away from:

* Sales pitches. While sharing solutions to challenges is encouraged, the emphasis should be on the problem-solving process and the use case itself, rather than the software or tools used, particularly if they are commercial products.
* Academic contributions or purely research-oriented presentations. The forum is intended to focus on practical applications and experiences, as there is no shortage of opportunities for academic discourse at scientific conferences.

Our primary interest lies in RDF-based Knowledge Graphs. Presentations on non-RDF graph technologies, such as property graphs, are generally of less interest, unless they specifically address integration with or transitioning to RDF systems and demonstrate how to bridge between different graph technologies.
