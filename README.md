# Knowledge Graph Forum

This repository is used for the call for sessions for the [Knowledge Graph Forum](https://dinacon.ch/knowledge-graph-forum-2019/). The first edition 2019 was a great success, please see the [separate page](2019/README.md) for links to videos & presentations (where available).

We plan to redo the event in 2020, information can be found here early 2020.

## How to propose a new session

If you would like to submit a session, simply create a [new issue](https://github.com/zazuko/knowledge-graph-forum/issues/new/choose) and fill out the *Knowledge Graph Unconfernce*  template by clicking on *Get Started*.
We have slots for 6 sessions of one hour each.
If we have more than 6 proposals, we will let participants vote upfront, most probably in the GitHub issues itself.

Please note that while we organize it mostly upfront to save time, the session should be unconference style: You are welcome to start and do a presentation of the topic on your own but it should not last longer than 20 minutes (we will be strict about that). The rest of the time should be used to have an interaction with the audience about the topic you present. There are screens in all rooms.

For a session proposal, we ask you to provide us with:
- What would you like to talk about
- Who might be interested in that (technical audience, management, data scientists, etc.)
- What would you like to know from other participants, what feedback are you looking for?
- What is your background (name, affiliation, etc)

## What we look for in the sessions

* Real-world use cases of RDF-based Knowledge Graphs.
* Any topic about scaling and using RDF in the real world. This includes prototypes, tools, libraries, etc.
* Lessons learned in using RDF Knowledge Graphs in the real world. We also welcome things that did not work out and projects that failed!

## What we do not look for

* Sales pitches. You are welcome to present whatever you used to solve your problem but focus on the use-case itself and the way you approached it and less on software, especially when it is commercial.
* Knowledge Graph Forum is strongly leaning towards RDF-based Knowledge Graphs. Other graph databases are of less interest.
* No paper or research presentations, there are enough conferences for these topics already.
