# Knowledge Graph Forum

This repository is used for the call for sessions for the Knowledge Graph Forum. 

The 2022 edition of the Knowledge Graph Forum will take place on September 29 2022 (Thursday). It will take place in Zurich, Switzerland (Area Viadukt/Industriequartier).

Call for presentation is now open! Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/zazuko/knowledge-graph-forum/issues) and use the CfP Issue Template and fill it out accordingly.

~The CfP is open until 31st of August 2022. We will followup one week later if your presentation is selected or not.~

1.9.2022: CfP is closed, thanks a lot for everyone applying! It looks like an excellent program and we will announce registration & sessions shortly.

Note that we expect you to show up for the event in case your presentation is selected! Do not apply if this can't be guaranteed. Presenters do not have to pay for the event, visitors will have to pay a small cover fee for the event to pay for location, food & stuff. Remaining expenses are payed/sponsored by us (Zazuko GmbH).

## Presentations 2019

The first edition 2019 was a great success, please see the [separate page](2019/README.md) for links to videos & presentations (where available).

## What we look for in the sessions

* Real-world use cases of RDF-based Knowledge Graphs.
* Any topic about scaling and using RDF in the real world. This includes prototypes, tools, libraries, etc.
* Lessons learned in using RDF Knowledge Graphs in the real world. We also welcome things that did not work out and projects that failed!
* If you are a consulting company, we prefer if your customer is doing the presentation.

## What we do not look for

* Sales pitches. You are welcome to present whatever you used to solve your problem but focus on the use-case itself and the way you approached it and less on software, especially when it is commercial.
* Knowledge Graph Forum is strongly leaning towards RDF-based Knowledge Graphs. Other graph databases are of less interest.
* No paper or research presentations, there are enough conferences for these topics already.
